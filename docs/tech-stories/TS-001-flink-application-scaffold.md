- ✅ Layered architecture (Domain, Processing, Connectors, Configuration)

### Core Components Delivered
- ✅ Domain models (Account, Product, ConcentrationResult, CashResult)
- ✅ Data processing pipelines with windowing support
- ✅ File source and sink connectors
- ✅ Configuration management with Spring Boot properties
- ✅ Aggregator templates with placeholder business logic

- [ ] ✅ Validate output file generation
- [ ] ✅ Complete within reasonable time limits

### AC4: Scaffold Templates
**Given** future development needs  
**When** developers implement business logic  
**Then** they should have:
- [ ] ✅ Clear placeholder locations marked with TODO
- [ ] ✅ Proper aggregator templates
- [ ] ✅ Sample data for testing
- [ ] ✅ Configuration examples
