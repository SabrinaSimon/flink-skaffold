# Agile Process for Technical Stories

## The Challenge: Functional Stories vs Technical Foundation

When you have **functional user stories** like:
- "As a risk manager, I want to calculate portfolio concentration..."
- "As a trader, I want to see cash positions..."

But these stories **cannot be implemented** without foundational technical work like our scaffold (TS-001).

## Process for Raising Technical Stories in Agile

### 1. **Identify the Gap During Sprint Planning**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Functional Story Review] --> B{Can we implement this?}
    B -->|No| C[Identify Technical Dependencies]
    B -->|Yes| D[Proceed with Story]
    C --> E[Create Technical Story]
    E --> F[Prioritize with PO]
    F --> G[Add to Backlog]
```

### 2. **The SPIDR Approach for Technical Stories**

When functional stories are **blocked by technical dependencies**:

| **S**tory | **P**roblem | **I**mpact | **D**ependency | **R**isk |
|-----------|-------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| US-001: Calculate Risk Concentration | No processing platform exists | Cannot deliver any risk features | Need Flink scaffold | High - Blocks all stories |
| US-002: Cash Position Dashboard | No data pipeline | No real-time data available | Need data processing | Medium - Can use batch initially |

### 3. **Conversation Framework with Product Owner**

#### **The "3-Why" Conversation:**

```
YOU: "We can't implement the concentration calculation story."

PO: "Why not?"

YOU: "Because we don't have a data processing platform."

PO: "Why don't we have one?"

YOU: "Because we're building a greenfield system and need foundational architecture."

PO: "Why is this technical work valuable?"

YOU: "Because without it, we can't deliver ANY of the 15 user stories in our roadmap."
```

#### **The Business Value Translation:**

```yaml
Technical Story: "Set up Flink processing scaffold"
Business Translation: "Enable all real-time data processing features"

Technical Value:
  - Unblocks: 15 functional stories worth 120 story points
  - Prevents: 3 weeks of rework if we build features without proper foundation
  - Enables: Scalable platform supporting 1000+ concurrent users
  - Reduces: Future technical debt by 60%
```

### 4. **Formal Process in Agile Events**

#### **During Backlog Refinement:**
1. **Surface Dependencies**: "Story X depends on technical foundation Y"
2. **Quantify Impact**: "Without Y, we can't deliver X, Z, A, B stories"
3. **Propose Solution**: "Technical Story TS-001 enables multiple functional stories"
4. **Request Prioritization**: "Should we prioritize foundation before features?"

#### **During Sprint Planning:**
```
SCENARIO: Team pulls functional story but identifies technical dependency

PROCESS:
1. Scrum Master: "What's blocking this story?"
2. Developer: "We need the Flink scaffold from TS-001"
3. Product Owner: "How long will TS-001 take?"
4. Team: "2 sprints, but it enables 8 other stories"
5. Decision: Swap functional story for TS-001 in current sprint
```

### 5. **Documentation & Justification Framework**

#### **Technical Story Justification Template:**

```markdown
## Technical Story Impact Analysis

### Functional Stories Blocked:
- [ ] US-001: Risk Concentration (13 SP) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] US-003: Cash Dashboard (8 SP) - HIGH PRIORITY  
- [ ] US-007: Portfolio Analytics (21 SP) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] US-012: Compliance Reporting (5 SP) - LOW PRIORITY

**Total Blocked Value**: 47 Story Points

### Technical Story Solution:
**TS-001**: Flink Application Scaffold (13 SP)

### Return on Investment:
- **Effort**: 13 SP (1.5 sprints)
- **Unlocks**: 47 SP (4-5 sprints of features)
- **ROI**: 3.6x immediate, 10x+ over project lifetime

### Risk of Delay:
- Sprint 2: 13 SP blocked
- Sprint 3: 34 SP blocked  
- Sprint 4: 47 SP blocked + technical debt accumulation
```

### 6. **Stakeholder Communication Strategy**

#### **For Product Owner:**
```
"We have 2 options:
1. Build features on shaky foundation → 3x rework later
2. Build solid foundation now → 3x faster feature delivery"
```

#### **For Business Stakeholders:**
```
"Think of this like building a house:
- Option 1: Start with rooms before foundation → House collapses
- Option 2: Build foundation first → Solid house that lasts"
```

### 7. **Agile Ceremonies Integration**

#### **Daily Standups:**
```
"Yesterday: Analyzed US-001 implementation
Today: Discovered we need TS-001 scaffold first  
Blockers: Need PO decision on prioritizing foundation work"
```

#### **Retrospectives:**
```
What went well: Identified technical dependencies early
What didn't: We should have scaffolding stories in initial backlog
Action item: Create technical debt assessment for each epic
```

### 8. **Creating Technical User Stories**

#### **Template for Technical Stories:**

```markdown
## Technical User Story Template

**Title**: TS-XXX: [Technical Component/Infrastructure]

**As a** [Role - Developer/System/Platform]
**I need** [Technical capability/infrastructure]  
**So that** [Business outcome/functional stories can be delivered]

### Background Context:
- Current state: [What exists today]
- Problem: [What's missing or broken]
- Solution approach: [Technical solution overview]

### Functional Stories Enabled:
- [ ] US-XXX: [Story] (X SP)
- [ ] US-XXX: [Story] (X SP)
**Total unlocked value**: X SP

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Technical requirement 1]
- [ ] [Technical requirement 2]
- [ ] [Integration test passes]
- [ ] [Documentation complete]

### Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to test environment
- [ ] Demo-able to stakeholders

### Technical Architecture:
[Include diagrams, patterns, technologies]

### Story Points: X
### Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] based on functional story dependencies
```

## Practical Action Plan

### **Immediate Steps (Today):**
1. **Audit current backlog** - Identify which functional stories need technical foundation
2. **Create dependency matrix** - Map functional stories to technical requirements
3. **Draft technical stories** using the template above
4. **Prepare business case** with ROI calculations

### **Next Sprint Planning:**
1. **Present dependency analysis** to Product Owner
2. **Propose technical story prioritization** 
3. **Get agreement** on foundation-first approach
4. **Re-sequence backlog** with technical stories first

### **Ongoing Process:**
1. **Include technical stories** in every epic planning
2. **Assess technical debt** in retrospectives  
3. **Maintain technical backlog** alongside functional backlog
4. **Regular architecture review** to identify future technical needs

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced Blocked Stories**: 0 functional stories blocked by missing technical foundation
- **Faster Feature Delivery**: 50% reduction in story implementation time after foundation
- **Lower Defect Rate**: 75% fewer production issues due to solid architecture
- **Team Velocity**: Consistent or increasing velocity after initial technical investment

## Key Principles

### **Technical Stories are NOT Technical Debt**
Technical stories are **foundational investments** that enable business value delivery, not cleanup work.

### **Business Value First**
Always frame technical work in terms of business outcomes and functional story enablement.

### **Proactive Planning**
Identify technical dependencies during epic planning, not during sprint execution.

### **ROI-Driven Prioritization**
Prioritize technical stories based on the functional value they unlock, not just technical elegance.
